## Description

As a developer, I wanted to create a timed quiz that my peers and I could take to assess our knowledge on basic java script. This is a dynamically designed project that can be easily
updated with more and/or newer questions.
The features of this quiz include a home page which gives the option to play the game or view the high scores, a set of rules so that the user knows how the game is played, and 
questions that are scored. When the user gets a question right, they are awarded a point. If they are wrong, they get 30 seconds deducted from their time. I then utalized local storage to 
let the user save their most recent high score!

## Technology Used

In this project I utalized Html 5, Css, and Vanilla Javascript
